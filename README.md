## For Styling

We're using Sass for styling. Most of the stylesheets should be named properly and added to scss/partials. If you add a new sheet here, make sure to include it into scss/globals.scss.

To compile your Sass, open a new tab in your terminal and run:

```
sass --watch scss/globals.scss:css/globals.css
```

If you keep this running, the css will update after changes to your .scss files.
